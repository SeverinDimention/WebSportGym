            <p> I was always very skinny and slender, sort of tough guy. 
                Really athletics helped me to get a weight and became amazing bodubuilder, 
                also I turned into a gym boss with a pretty good shape and definitly earned recognition and respect from different peolpe.
                 Sometimes the gym helped me to carry out the depression and came through oturageous problems. It's a good place to become better version of yourself. 
                 For the reason I was flattered and humbled by this community's creativity.</p>

            <p> The community has a lot of subject material and practices to learn, thus it's a good place to get started your way to the fitness world.
                But as far as you work in the gym you can also just forget 'bout some real problems, and do not try to be a fanatic of it. 
                Only one negative moment it's existance off russion terrorist state!
                All we need is the gym. It's the best place to take a rest of everyday pressue and become more patient and happy.
